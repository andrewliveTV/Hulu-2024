***As the competition between video streaming services intensifies, differentiation becomes an increasingly important factor. Hulu leans into that idea by offering a strong on-demand streaming library and a robust live TV option. The service is excellent for watching popular TV shows, and it has broad platform support (even if Hulu's original series are hit-or-miss affairs). On the live TV front, Hulu has top-notch channel coverage, and its DVR features compare well with the competition's offerings. Simply put, no other service matches its combination of video streaming content.***
